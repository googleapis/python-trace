                ``MINIMAL``.
            page_size (int): The maximum number of resources contained in the
                underlying API response. If page streaming is performed per-
                resource, this parameter does not affect the return value. If page

            filter_ (str): Optional. A filter against labels for the request.

                By default, searches use prefix matching. To specify exact match,
                prepend a plus symbol (``+``) to the search term. Multiple terms are
                ANDed. Syntax:

                -  ``root:NAME_PREFIX`` or ``NAME_PREFIX``: Return traces where any root
                   span starts with ``NAME_PREFIX``.
                -  ``+root:NAME`` or ``+NAME``: Return traces where any root span's name
                   is exactly ``NAME``.
                -  ``span:NAME_PREFIX``: Return traces where any span starts with
                   ``NAME_PREFIX``.
                -  ``+span:NAME``: Return traces where any span's name is exactly
                   ``NAME``.
                -  ``latency:DURATION``: Return traces whose overall latency is greater
                   or equal to than ``DURATION``. Accepted units are nanoseconds
                   (``ns``), milliseconds (``ms``), and seconds (``s``). Default is
                   ``ms``. For example, ``latency:24ms`` returns traces whose overall
                   latency is greater than or equal to 24 milliseconds.
                -  ``label:LABEL_KEY``: Return all traces containing the specified label
                   key (exact match, case-sensitive) regardless of the key:value pair's
                   value (including empty values).
                -  ``LABEL_KEY:VALUE_PREFIX``: Return all traces containing the
                   specified label key (exact match, case-sensitive) whose value starts
                   with ``VALUE_PREFIX``. Both a key and a value must be specified.
                -  ``+LABEL_KEY:VALUE``: Return all traces containing a key:value pair
                   exactly matching the specified text. Both a key and a value must be
                   specified.
                -  ``method:VALUE``: Equivalent to ``/http/method:VALUE``.
                -  ``url:VALUE``: Equivalent to ``/http/url:VALUE``.
            order_by (str): Optional. Field used to sort the returned traces. Can be one of the
                following:

                -  ``trace_id``
                -  ``name`` (``name`` field of root span in the trace)
                -  ``duration`` (difference between ``end_time`` and ``start_time``
                   fields of the root span)
                -  ``start`` (``start_time`` field of the root span)

                Descending order can be specified by appending ``desc`` to the sort
                field (for example, ``name desc``).

                Only one sort field is permitted.
            retry (Optional[google.api_core.retry.Retry]):  A retry object used
                to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will
                be retried using a default configuration.
            timeout (Optional[float]): The amount of time, in seconds, to wait
                for the request to complete. Note that if ``retry`` is
                specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
            metadata (Optional[Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]]): Additional metadata
                that is provided to the method.

        Returns:
            A :class:`~google.api_core.page_iterator.PageIterator` instance.
            An iterable of :class:`~google.cloud.trace_v1.types.Trace` instances.
            You can also iterate over the pages of the response
            using its `pages` property.

        Raises:

        Gets a single trace by its ID.

        Example:

            >>> client = trace_v1.TraceServiceClient()

            >>> trace_id = ''
            >>>
            >>> response = client.get_trace(project_id, trace_id)

        Args:
            project_id (str): Required. ID of the Cloud project where the trace data is stored.
            trace_id (str): Required. ID of the trace to return.
            retry (Optional[google.api_core.retry.Retry]):  A retry object used
                to retry requests. If ``None`` is specified, requests will
                be retried using a default configuration.
            timeout (Optional[float]): The amount of time, in seconds, to wait
                for the request to complete. Note that if ``retry`` is
                specified, the timeout applies to each individual attempt.
            metadata (Optional[Sequence[Tuple[str, str]]]): Additional metadata
                that is provided to the method.

        Returns:
            A :class:`~google.cloud.trace_v1.types.Trace` instance.

        Raises:
            google.api_core.exceptions.GoogleAPICallError: If the request
                    failed for any reason.
            google.api_core.exceptions.RetryError: If the request failed due
                    to a retryable error and retry attempts failed.
            ValueError: If the parameters are invalid.
